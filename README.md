# Keep Notes

This is a clone of Google Keep. While making this mini project, I learnt about local Storage,JSON and some features in JS.Once you fill in a note it's saved in the local storage and will be displayed on the website even after closing the website and visiting it later as it is saved in your local storage and gets deleted once you delete it using the delete button. You can use this website to keep a track of your tasks ðŸ™‚
